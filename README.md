## Introduction
**Welcome to the Nodejs-Express-Guide!**

**Congratulations** on taking the first step toward mastering backend development with **Node.js** and **Express.js**! This guide will lead you through essential concepts, empowering you to build robust, efficient, and scalable server-side applications. By the end of this journey, you'll have the skills to develop real-world projects and confidently tackle a variety of backend development tasks.

The **Node.js** and **Express.js** Guide is designed for both beginners and experienced developers looking to expand their expertise. **Node.js**, an open-source, cross-platform runtime, allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Coupled with **Express.js**â€”a lightweight, fast, and flexible web application frameworkâ€”it simplifies the development of modern web applications.

**In this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to:**

* Build and manage servers efficiently using Express.js.
* Design and implement RESTful APIs with clean and modular code.
* Interact with databases to store and retrieve data seamlessly.
* Handle authentication and authorization securely.
* Use middleware to extend functionality and handle requests effectively.
* Leverage popular tools and libraries to streamline your development process.

**Node.js** and **Express.js** power many cutting-edge technologies, from real-time applications to microservices and serverless architectures. Their growing popularity makes them top choices for backend development.

This guide is written in a friendly, conversational style to keep you engaged and make learning enjoyable. Whether you're a visual learner or prefer hands-on coding, you'll find everything you need to succeed right here.

For additional support and to connect with fellow learners, join our dedicated Telegram group. Feel free to ask questions, share your progress, and collaborate with othersâ€”itâ€™s a shared learning experience!

Your feedback is invaluable. Please share your thoughts and testimonials about the **Node.js and Express.js Guide**. Letâ€™s make backend development an exciting and rewarding journey together.

Welcome to the **Node.js and Express.js** Guideâ€”letâ€™s get started!

## Requirements

1. Motivation
2. A browser
3. A code editor
4. Basic Command Line
5. Basic JavaScript

## Setup

I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started.

**Install Node.js**

**Node.js is the engine that powers your backend development journey.** Without it, you canâ€™t run backend JavaScript code or build the server-side components of your applications. So, installing Node.js is the first step in your path to mastering backend development. 

InstallÂ [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) here.

![node-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2469ee3-06c6-472c-bd20-16d382346c6a)

After downloading double click and install

![done-install-node](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d13adf-9cda-400d-9839-cc94b0f2d853)

**Note** : when you install Node.js, npm **(Node Package Manager)** is included automatically. You do not need to install npm separately.

We can check if node and npm is installed on our local machine by opening our device terminal or command prompt.

- Check version of node.

```sh
node -v
```
- Check version of npm.
  
```sh
npm -v
```

If both commands return version numbers, you have successfully installed Node.js and npm.

## Browser

There are many browsers out there. However, I strongly recommend Google Chrome.

**Installing Google Chrome**

InstallÂ [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)Â if you do not have one yet.

**Opening Google Chrome Console**

You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three dots at the top right corner of the browser, SelectingÂ **More tools** -> **Developer tools**.

![open-developer-tool](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7e494e2-3ead-4689-a184-17c3b8865fca)

Using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts : **Ctrl + Shift + J** or Press Key **F12**.
